# 🔍 Replit Prompt: Clear Search UX Improvement

## 🎯 Objective

Improve the search experience by allowing users to easily reset their search and view the full dictionary again without needing to manually delete the text or refresh the page.

Also apply two small visual styling adjustments as follows (no logic changes).

---

## ✅ Feature: Contextual "Clear" Button

### Behavior:

* When a search query is active (i.e. input is not empty), display a small ✖️ button
* Clicking the button should:

  * Clear the search input
  * Reset the filtered results to show the full database
  * Optionally scroll the page back to the top for clarity

### Design Option:

Place the ✖️ button **inside the input** (right-aligned), like this:

```tsx
{searchQuery && (
  <button
    onClick={clearSearch}
    className="absolute right-12 top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 text-gray-400 hover:text-gray-600"
    aria-label="Clear search"
  >
    ✖️
  </button>
)}
```

Wrap the search input in a `relative` container:

```tsx
<div className="relative w-full">
  <input ... />
  {/* ✖️ button renders here when active */}
</div>
```

### Logic:

```tsx
const clearSearch = () => {
  setSearchQuery("")
  setFilteredSuggestions([])
  window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: "smooth" })
}
```

## 🎨 Additional Visual Styling Fixes (Do Not Skip)

### 1. Adjust spacing between ❌ and Search button (hero search only)

* The "clear" ✖️ icon is currently too close to the Search button on the large (hero) search bar
* Add horizontal spacing (e.g. `mr-2`) between the ✖️ icon and the button
* Do **not** change anything in the sticky search bar — spacing there is correct

### 2. Equal vertical padding in sticky search bar

* In the sticky search bar's container, the top and bottom vertical padding are currently mismatched
* Adjust styling so that **top and bottom spacing are visually equal**
* Match the bottom spacing as the standard, and apply it to the top

---

## 🧼 Constraints

* Do not modify any existing design layout or search logic
* Only enhance the UI by conditionally rendering this button when `searchQuery !== ""`
* Maintain consistent spacing and alignment with the app’s current design system

---

## ✅ Summary

Add a ✖️ button inside the search input that appears when a user is actively searching. Clicking it clears the input and resets the view to the full dataset. Also fix the spacing between the ✖️ icon and the search button in the hero input, and ensure equal vertical padding around the sticky search bar.
