📘 Project: The Thai Dictionary 🇹🇭

🎯 Objective

Introduce a new sticky header search component that appears only when the user scrolls down the page — without modifying the existing layout or design in any way. This sticky search bar should match the existing visual design system and improve UX for users navigating the word list.

🆕 Feature: Sticky Search Bar on Scroll

🔁 Behavior

This is a second, standalone component.

It must not affect or alter the current centered hero search bar.

Appears only after the user scrolls down approximately 300px.

Use useEffect and useState in React to control visibility based on window.scrollY.

It should fade in or slide in smoothly — not snap.

📌 Sticky Positioning

Use Tailwind classes:

sticky top-0 z-30

The sticky bar should overlay the content beneath it.

It should not occupy space at initial load or shift layout.

🎨 Styling – Match Existing Design System

Use the same Tailwind design tokens and styling already used throughout the app:

🧼 Design Constraints

❌ Do not touch the existing hero layout, header, or search bar.

❌ Do not reuse the original component — this is a new, separate component.

✅ Use only existing colors, spacing, typography, and corner styles.

✅ Keep emoji-friendly, soft, and inviting feel.

✅ Ensure accessibility and responsiveness.

✅ Summary

Add a second sticky search component that enhances usability for repeat searches — matching the original design system visually and behaviorally, without altering the original layout.
